# Chipatala Connect – Technical Strategy Document

## 1. Project Overview
Chipatala Connect is a digital health passport system designed to replace the traditional paper-based health passports widely used in Malawi for recording diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment history, and other medical records. The system addresses the challenges of fragmented hospital information systems and the risk of data loss, damage, or duplication associated with physical health passports.

The core concept is to empower patients to securely own and store their medical records on their personal devices while enabling controlled, temporary access to healthcare providers when needed.

## 2. Problem Statement
### 2.1 Paper-Based Health Passports
Most patients rely on physical health passports that:
- Are easily lost, damaged, or forgotten
- Cannot be efficiently backed up
- Limit accessibility across different hospitals
- Require manual updates by healthcare workers

### 2.2 Fragmented Hospital Information Systems
Healthcare facilities often use isolated and incompatible record systems, leading to:
- Difficulty in sharing patient data across hospitals
- Repetition of tests and diagnostics
- Delays in treatment decisions
- Inefficient patient history tracking

## 3. Project Objectives
- Replace paper-based health passports with a secure digital alternative
- Enable patients to own and control their health data
- Facilitate secure and temporary data sharing between patients and healthcare providers
- Improve continuity of care across multiple healthcare facilities
- Reduce administrative workload and medical record errors

## 4. Core Concept
Chipatala Connect operates on a patient-centric data model where:
- Medical data is generated by healthcare providers
- Patients receive and store their medical records on their personal devices
- Hospitals do not permanently store patient records within the Chipatala Connect system
- Access to records is granted only with explicit patient consent

This ensures privacy, data ownership, and portability.

## 5. Key Features
### 5.1 Digital Health Passport
- Secure digital record stored on the patient’s mobile device
- Contains diagnoses, prescriptions, treatment history, lab results, and health status
- Structured and standardized medical record format

### 5.2 QR-Based Record Transfer
- Doctor generates a digital medical report
- System creates a secure QR code
- Patient scans the QR code to receive and store the report locally

### 5.3 Temporary Access Control
- Doctors can only view patient data with explicit consent
- Session-based access (time-limited)
- Automatic revocation after session expiry

### 5.4 Offline Capability
- Local storage of records on patient devices
- Functionality in low-connectivity environments
- Sync options when internet becomes available

### 5.5 Interoperability Support
- Standardized data format for cross-hospital compatibility
- API-based integration with existing hospital systems

## 6. System Architecture
### 6.1 High-Level Architecture
The system will follow a decentralized, patient-owned data architecture consisting of:
- Patient Mobile Application
- Doctor/Hospital Web or Desktop Interface
- Secure Access Gateway
- Optional Cloud Relay (for encrypted transfer only, not storage)

### 6.2 Component Description
#### a) Patient Application
- Stores encrypted health records locally
- Generates consent tokens for data access
- Scans QR codes to import medical records
- Displays medical history and prescriptions

#### b) Doctor Interface
- Generates digital reports and prescriptions
- Requests temporary access to patient data
- Reads patient records only during authorized sessions

#### c) Secure Access Layer
- Handles authentication and consent verification
- Issues temporary access keys
- Logs access sessions for accountability

## 7. Data Flow
### 7.1 Record Creation Flow
1. Doctor examines patient
2. Doctor creates diagnosis/report in the system
3. System generates encrypted QR code
4. Patient scans QR code
5. Record is securely stored on patient’s device

### 7.2 Data Sharing Flow
1. Patient visits a hospital
2. Doctor requests access to patient records
3. Patient grants temporary access via consent (QR or token)
4. Doctor views records during active session
5. Access automatically expires after session ends

## 8. Security and Privacy Strategy
### 8.1 Data Ownership
- Patients are the primary owners of their medical data
- No permanent centralized storage of patient records

### 8.2 Encryption
- End-to-end encryption for all medical records
- Encrypted QR code transmission
- Local encrypted storage on devices

### 8.3 Consent-Based Access
- Explicit patient authorization required for every session
- Time-limited access tokens
- Zero-trust access model

### 8.4 Compliance Considerations
- Alignment with healthcare data privacy best practices
- Secure audit logs for medical accountability

## 9. Technology Stack (Proposed)
### 9.1 Frontend
- Mobile App: Flutter or React Native
- Doctor Portal: React.js or Angular

### 9.2 Backend
- Node.js or Django (for secure session and access control)
- RESTful APIs for system communication

### 9.3 Data Standards
- FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for medical data formatting
- JSON-based encrypted medical records

### 9.4 Security Tools
- AES-256 Encryption for local storage
- OAuth 2.0 / Token-based authentication
- QR Code secure encoding

## 10. Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Research & Requirements
- Stakeholder interviews (patients and hospitals)
- System requirements analysis
- Regulatory assessment

### Phase 2: System Design
- UI/UX design for patient and doctor applications
- Database and encryption architecture
- API design and interoperability planning

### Phase 3: Development
- Mobile application development
- Doctor interface development
- Secure access and QR transfer module

### Phase 4: Testing
- Security testing
- Usability testing in healthcare environments
- Pilot deployment in selected hospitals

### Phase 5: Deployment & Scaling
- Gradual rollout to hospitals and clinics
- Training for healthcare staff
- Continuous system monitoring and updates

## 11. Expected Impact
- Improved healthcare record accessibility
- Reduced loss of patient medical history
- Faster and more accurate diagnoses
- Enhanced patient privacy and data control
- Better coordination between healthcare facilities

## 12. Team Structure (Five-Member Team)
- Project Manager: Oversees planning and coordination
- Backend Developer: Handles APIs, security, and access control
- Mobile App Developer: Builds patient application
- Frontend/Web Developer: Builds doctor interface
- UI/UX & Research Lead: User experience design and field research

## 13. Future Enhancements
- Integration with national health systems
- Biometric authentication support
- Emergency access mode
- Cloud backup (optional and user-controlled)
- AI-assisted health insights and analytics

## 14. Conclusion
Chipatala Connect presents a scalable and privacy-focused solution to modernize Malawi’s healthcare record system by transitioning from fragile paper-based passports to secure, patient-owned digital health passports. By leveraging QR-based record transfer, decentralized storage, and consent-driven access control, the system ensures security, interoperability, and accessibility while maintaining patient autonomy over medical data.
